**What's the #1 job search "secret"?** Involve real “people” in your job search as much as possible.

Let that sink in for a second. **Involve real “people” in your job search as much as possible.**

Ultimately, the work world is all about people collaborating toward a common purpose, whether it be higher profits, educating children, or saving the planet. Similarly, the job search is about people (including you) collaborating to find a place where your skills/talents will be put to good use.

Resumes, cover letters, job boards, LinkedIn, and application systems are merely tools to help you collaborate with people. Behind these tools are real people with hopes, dreams, fears, and feelings. There’s no substitute for meaningful interactions with real people.

What’s the second most important thing to remember? There’s no “right” way to involve real people in your job search. **Just do it as much as possible.**

Apart from “please”, “thank you” and good manners, everyone has a different opinion what this should look like. Should I write a handwritten thank you card, or is an e-mail sufficient? Should I wait 3 days to follow up, or is 2 weeks more appropriate? First names or formal titles? Tuxedo or blazer? Ask 100 hiring managers and recruiters these questions, and you’ll get 100 different answers.

Expect that you’ll make mistakes, and maybe even offend some people. That’s OK. Why? We’re complicated, unpredictable creatures. And ultimately, you’ll find a dream job faster through meaningful interactions with real people.

**Get personal!** We’ve included tips to help you include “real people” every step of your job search. Just look for the **Get personal!** section on every page.
