Title: Prepare for my job interview

----

Text: 

There’s no magic to a successful interview - it’s all about preparation. Which is why we’ve included interview preparation as a separate section in the Playbook.

Start by asking your contact what to expect during the interview. Phone screen? Behavior-based interview questions? Panel interview? Case interview? Skills test? Your preparation will look a little different for each.

----

Get-personal: Start by asking the recruiter or a current employee what you can expect - anyone who’s “been there” before. Ask for advice how you can prepare. Then, ask for a practice interview. If you’ve been told to expect a behavior-based interview, ask a career coach or hiring manager in the industry to give you a mock interview with feedback.
