Title: Ace my job interview

----

Text: 

By the time you get to the interview, you’ve already done 90% of the work. (Yes, interview preparation described in the previous section is that important!) 

Now just take care of your physical well being and presence - it’s all about the important basics. Get plenty of rest the night before. Dress appropriately. Eat a healthy meal. Arrive plenty early so you’re not rushed. If it’s a phone interview, find a quiet room well before the interview starts.

During the interview, be polite to everyone you meet. Important - get the names and email addresses of everyone you meet, for “thank you” messages later.

----

Get-personal: Ask someone who knows you well - a friend, acquaintance, or career coach - for tips how to show up your best.
