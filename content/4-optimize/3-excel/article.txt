Title: Excel in the first 90 days

----

Text: 

Congrats, you landed the job! 

So now what? There’s work to do! You only get benefit of the doubt as the “newbie” for a short time, so it’s important to be intentional how you spend the first weeks and months on the job. First impressions matter and sometimes follow us for a long, long time.

----

Get-personal: More than anything, the first 90 days is about paying close attention to relationships with your co-workers and navigating the new environment. Probably more important than the job itself. Find a mentor or colleague both in and outside the organization to talk about what’s happening. Also see our section (link: http://playbook.work/optimize/mentor text: Network and Mentor for Long-Run Success).
