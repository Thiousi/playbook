Title: Adjust my job search strategy

----

Text: There’s no single “right” way to look for a job. It looks a little different for each of us and evolves over time. What matters - continually evaluate how well you’re using time. Evaluate what’s working well, and do more of it. Eliminate the strategies that aren’t working well, and replace them with something else.

Get-personal: Ask a trusted professional mentor, colleague, or (link: https://hbr.org/2015/03/find-the-career-coach-whos-right-for-you text: career coach) to help evaluate your job search. Use the resources above as a guide. This person needn’t be an “expert” per se. Discussing your strategy with someone who’s not living your job search every day can be really helpful.
