Text:

Looking for a job is tough, sometimes even aggravating. You get rejected a lot and ultimately don’t control the outcome. We get it.

That’s why it’s important to take care of yourself. Getting regular sleep, time with loved ones, exercise, healthy eating, and having “fun” are all basic building blocks for your success.

Get-personal: Now’s the time to be in touch with friends and family. Attend a baseball game with a colleague you haven’t seen in a while. Schedule a day trip with your kids outside home. Go out, be active, and have fun! These basic suggestions are effective.
