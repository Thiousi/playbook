**Step #1** - Identify your personal success factors. Success and happiness at work is about more than job title or salary. 

What are “personal success factors”? Author Richard N. Bolles describes 7 work characteristics that lead to job satisfaction in his book “What Color Is Your Parachute,” the time-tested resource for this self-discovery process.

Start by filling out the 1-page “Flower Exercise” to identify your success factors in these 7 categories. Read the instructions in “What Color Is Your Parachute”. **Don’t skip the instructions!** You can find older editions on Amazon for $5.00 or less.

**Step #2** - Find job titles and organizations that fit your “personal success factors”.
